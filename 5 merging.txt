 After completing work in different branch we have to merge it.
 As changes done in different branch is unknown to main, we have to merge it.

 Merging can be done by 2 methods 
  1 By PR (pull request)

    after push to new branch go to github
    There compare and merge option  will be shown click on that


  2 By terminal
    >> git diff  branchname   


    git diff  = to compare 2 branch, commit,files.

    branchname = name of that branch with which we want to compare our working branch

    >> git merge  branchname

    branchname = name of branch to which we want to merge our working branch
    

Message of git diff looks like :
