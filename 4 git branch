# Branch command

1    git branch  (to check branch)
2   git branch -M newname  (to rename branch)
3   git checkout <branch name>   (to navigate branch)
4   git checkout -b <new branch name> (to make new branch)

5   git -d <branchname>  (to delete branch)
 checkout before delete

 # Workflow

1  Create new branch by 
     >> git checkout -b  newfilename
    
    This branch will be exact copy of repo at that instant.

2  Do your stuff, add, commit.
3 push it to "origin branchname"
    Here branchname will be your working branchnane.
 Don't push to "origin main" as main does not contain stuff done in other branch

 4 Merge with  main either by PR or diff and merge
 More on merging in next file.
