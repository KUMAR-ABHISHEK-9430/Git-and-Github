In this we will see how repo can be made in local machine and linked with Github.

To make any folder to git folder first make folder and initialze git by writing this command
    >> git init
To check if the folder is git folder or not we can do by writting this command in terminal
    >> ls -Force  
or by  >> ls -a
or >> dir /a

After git is initialze we write the following command to link local repo to github
    >> git remote add origin  link_repo

link_repo = is obtain by creating repo on github.

After linking do your work add it, commit it.Then proceed.

After linking local repo to github to check branch by 
    >> git remote -v

Branch should be either main or your desired branch.
    >> git branch

If branch is "master" change it to main by 
    >> git branch -M main
    the above command is for changing branch name

After that push code by 
    >> git push origin main
    or by 
    >> git push -u origin main
    here "-u"  represent upstream by this we can avoid writing git push origin main repeatitively if we are working on same repo for long time.
    Once written after that we have to only write 
    >> git push 


## Work flow

1 make folder
2 change working directory by cd command
3 initialize git init
4 link folder to github by git remote add origin
5 do your work
6 add your work
7 commit 
8 check branch and rename to main
9 push
