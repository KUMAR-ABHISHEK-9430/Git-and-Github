To get content of repo to your local machine
use this command
>> git clone repo link


To get status of changes use this command
>> git status

There are 4 types of status:
 1   U = untracked i.e. These files about which github  does not know. These fiels are not previously commited.
 2  M = modified i.e.  There have been some changes in these files.
3   S = staged i.e. These fiels are ready to be commited.   
status change to staged after we "add" those changes by the below command.
 >> git add  filename

 or to add all changes we use this command.
 >> git add .

4  Unmodified i.e. There have been no change in this fiels.
    This happens after the changes have been commited.
